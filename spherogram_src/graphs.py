"""
Python implementation of graphs, reduced graphs, directed graphs, fat
graphs (graphs with ordered adjacency lists) and fat directed graphs.

Vertices are arbitrary hashable python objects. Graph methods must
not change vertices.

To instantiate a graph, provide a list of edges, as pairs of vertices,
and an optional list of additional vertices, which may be isolated.
Vertices are saved as a set, so redundancies in the vertex list will
be ignored.  Edges are saved as a list, so multiple edges are allowed.

If G is a graph and v a vertex of G then G[v] is a list of vertices
adjacent to v.  If there are n edges joining v to w then w will
appear in this list n times.  If G is a digraph, then G[v] returns
a list of all endpoints of edges having either head or tail at v.
There additional Digraph methods to get lists of incoming or outgoing
edges.

For most graphs G, G(v) returns the set of edges incident to G.
In the case of a FatGraph, the return value is the ordered list
of incident edges.  (Loops will appear twice).

When called as a function, an edge is the non-trivial involution of
its endpoints; calling it with one endpoint returns the other one.

One can iterate over edges as:

for x, y in G.edges:
  ...

where x and y will be the two endpoints of the edge (ordered as
tail, head in the case of directed edges).
